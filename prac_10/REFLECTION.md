1. When I provided estimates I almost always underestimated how long a task would take. This highlights the difference
between watching the lectures and using the skills taught in them. I found that i needed to refer back to in-class 
examples a lot more than predicted.
2. When I partook in code reviews, the feedback I gained was helpful but providing feedback was more valuable. By giving
feedback, I was able to critically analysing another student and deepen by understanding of concepts I already and find
new ways of solving problems I'd been struggling with.
3. I can't think of anything to change about the practicals. If students put in the time, the progression of tasks from 
"step through" to "do it from scratch" was the perfect for learning and the practice and extension tasks were always 
if a student wanted to excel.
